Waldisa Rússio became the first Brazilian museologist to publish theoretical texts in Museology that were broadly disseminated by this committee . Some months before her death , Rússio was involved in the organization of the “I Latin American Seminar of Museology” , conceived with the Institute of Museology of São Paulo that was held in the Latin America Memorial in São Paulo in 1990 . The Seminar program puts in evidence the particular concerns of the museologist with cultural problems related to heritage and the insertion of professional training in this context , which is a topic that was already approached in her academic researches . Waldisa Rússio , as well as Tereza Scheiner , took part in a specific group of ICOFOM thinkers that insisted in the scientific character of museology internationally , allowing it to be conceived as a social science or an applied social science since the 1980s . In the theory produced within ICOFOM International Committee for Museology , Rússio has conceived the notion of “museological fact” or “museum fact” , her most known and representative theoretical conception which was derivative of the social fact proposed by Durkheim and Mauss in the field of Sociology . The “museological fact” is thought as the relation of man to the objects of reality and , according to Rússio , it would configure the true object of study of Museology :"
